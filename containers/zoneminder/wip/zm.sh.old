#1. Unless you are already using the MySQL server or you are running it
#   remotely you will need to ensure that the server is installed and secured:

yum install mysql-server
systemctl enable mariadb
systemctl start mariadb
mysql_secure_installation

#2. You will need to create the ZoneMinder database. These commands should do
#   the trick, assuming your database server is local:

mysql -u root -p < /usr/share/zoneminder/db/zm_create.sql
mysqladmin reload

#3. The database needs a user.  One is not created by default because this would
#   introduce an obvious security issue.  The following should set this up:

mysql -u root -p
grant select,insert,update,delete on zm.* to 'zmuser'@localhost identified by 'zmpass';

#   Obviously, change at least zmpass to an actual, secure password or
#   passphrase.  You can change zmuser as well if you like.

#4. Edit /etc/zm.conf and, at the bottom, change ZM_DB_PASS and perhaps
#   ZM_DB_USER to match.

#5. Edit /etc/php.ini, uncomment the date.timezone line, and add your local
#   timezone.  For whatever reason, PHP will complain loudly if this is not set,
#   or if it is set incorrectly, and these complaints will show up in the
#   zoneminder logging system as errors.
#
#   If you are not sure of the proper timezone specification to use, run
#   timedatectl.

#6. This package probably does not work with SELinux enabled at the moment. It
##   may be necessary to disable SELinux for httpd, or even completely for
#   ZoneMinder to function. The policy is being worked on and the issues will be
#   addressed in a later release.  Run

     setenforce 0

##   for testing, and edit /etc/sysconfig/selinux to disable it at boot time.

     systemctl enable zoneminder
     systemctl start zoneminder

#8. The ZoneMinder web interface is disabled by default (which makes it rather
#   useless but also secure by default), you will need to edit
#   /etc/httpd/conf.d/zoneminder.conf to enable it.  Afterwards, you can start
#   the web server:

     systemctl enable httpd.service
     systemctl start httpd.service
